This is a game I am working on to learn more about programming for multiplayer in Unreal 5.

I've only uploaded the source code due to file size limitations.

I am currently working on sound design and implementation with the main gameplay features already finished.
I decided not to use a Wwise or FMOD implementation in this project so I could learn more about Unreal's built in audio features.
